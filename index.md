# Washing Your Dog

### [Steps](/steps/)

### [FAQ](/faq/)

### [Additional Info](/Additional Info/)

On your FAQ page, you have a link to a website about shampoos. I suggest moving that to this Additional Info page.

Overall, I think you have a good start to your website. I think you should add pictures to go along with your pages to make them better. Also try to think of some other things people may want to know about washing a dog (for example, how often should they wash their dog, is it better to get the dog groomed or wash at home, etc).
